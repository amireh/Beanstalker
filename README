Beanstalker

Is a Sinatra-powered web interface for monitoring beanstalkd, a light-weight messaging system written in C.
Beanstalker interacts with beanstalkd through the Ruby interface implemented in the gem 'beanstalk-client'.

Dependencies:
* RubyGems
* sinatra ( >= 0.9.4 )
* sinatra-content-for ( >= 0.2)
* beanstalk-client (fork by sugarfly, >= 1.0.3)
* rack-flash ( >= 0.1.1 )

Please note that for Beanstalker to work, you must obtain:
a) the forked version of beanstalk-client
b) patched version of the server beanstalkd

To get the compliant ruby gem version:
  $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
  $ sudo gem install sugarfly-beanstalk-client-ruby

For the patched version of the server, however, I will be posting my patches to the beanstalkd mailing list with a request to integrate the changes into the main ref. Until then, you can grab the source from the following link:
  git clone git://powerpuffcow.com/beanstalkd.git
and compile it yourself:
  $ ./configure && make
